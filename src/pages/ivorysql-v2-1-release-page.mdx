### Overview

IvorySQL 2.1 is based on PostgreSQL 15.1 and contains a variety of fixes from Postgres community and new feature since IvorySQL 1.5.

This release is compatible with IvorySQL 1.5 and does not require a dump/restore for those running IvorySQL 1.X. 

IvorySQL 2.1 contains a variety of fixes from PostgreSQL 15.0 and 15.1, including improved sort Performance and Compression, logging and configuration enhancement, more fine-tuned logical replication options, etc. For more detailed updates and bug fixes in PostgreSQL 15 and 15.1, please refer to the official [PostgreSQL 15.0 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.0/) and [PostgreSQL 15.1 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.1/).

### New feature
[**Global unique index**]

“Global unique index” is a unique index on a partitioned table that can ensure cross-partition uniqueness using a non-partition key. This feature can be used in Postgres and Oracle compatibility modes.

This work is inspired by this email thread, “Proposal: Global Index” started back in 2019. Our team took a different approach to implement the feature that ensures uniqueness constraint spanning multiple partitions without heavy modification to current Postgres’s partitioned table/index structure. In other words, a global unique index and a regular partitioned index are essentially the same in terms of their storage structure except that one can do cross-partition uniqueness check, the other cannot.Global unique index can be created with "GLOBAL" and "UNIQUE" clauses in a "CREATE INDEX" statement run against a partitioned table. For example,

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX global_index ON idxpart(bid) GLOBAL;

With a global unqiue index created, cross partition uniqueness can be guaranteed with INSERT, UPDATE, ATTACH and DETACH operations.
