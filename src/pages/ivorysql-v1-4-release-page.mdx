# IvorySQL Release - 1.4

## [**Download**](https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL/releases/tag/Ivory_REL_1_4)

## Release Notes
[**Release Date: Jun 28, 2022**]
### Overview

IvorySQL 1.4 is based on PostgreSQL 14.4 and contains a variety of fixes and new feature from IvorySQL 1.3.

This release is compatible with IvorySQL 1.3 and does not require a dump/restore for those running IvorySQL 1.X. 

It contains a variety of fixes from 14.3, specifically fixes an issue with [CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html)
and [REINDEX CONCURRENTLY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.html) that could cause silent data corruption of indexes.
Prior to the fix, CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY and REINDEX CONCURRENTLY could build indexes that would have missing entries, causing
SELECT queries that used the index to not find certain rows. More details can be found at [14.4 release](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-144-released-2470/)

if you have any indexes that were created using the CONCURRENTLY option under 14.X, you should re-index them after updating. See the first
changelog entry of PostgreSQL [14.4 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.4/)

For updates and bug fixes in PostgreSQL 14.4 please refer to the official PostgreSQL [14.4 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.4/).
