# Welcome to Developers


## Roadmap

IvorySQL is a noncommercial, all volunteer, free software project, and as such there is no formal list of feature requirements required for development. We enjoy allowing developers to explore the topics of their choosing, though we also ensure that all new features committed to IvorySQL are thoroughly vetted by our community of contributors and committers.

### Minor Releases

The IvorySQL project aims to follow a predefined schedule, releasing at least one minor version per quarter. If additional releases are needed due to critical bug fixes or security issues, more releases will be made between these dates, so this list should be considered a minimum. IvorySQL closely follows PostgreSQL's release schedule, ensuring that a new minor version with the latest kernel updates will be released every quarter.

The version release schedule for this year is as follows:

- 1st Quarter: Release v5.3 (PG Kernel 18.3)
- 2nd Quarter: Release v5.4 (PG Kernel 18.4)
- 3rd Quarter: Release v5.5 (PG Kernel 18.5)
- 4th Quarter: Release v5.6 (PG Kernel 18.6)

### Next Major Release
The next major version of IvorySQL is planned as v6.0, scheduled for release in Q4 2026. The current IvorySQL v6.0  development progress can be tracked on the [GitHub Project page](https://github.com/orgs/IvorySQL/projects/28).

### Previously Implemented Compatibility Features
For Oracle-compatible features implemented in previous versions, please refer to the [Oracle Compatibility List](https://docs.ivorysql.org/en/ivorysql-doc/master/oracle_compatibility/compat_case_conversion) in IvorySQL Documentation Center.
