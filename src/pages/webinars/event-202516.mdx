    <div className="content-text">
      On December 13, 2025, from 15:00 to 16:00 Beijing time, the Oracle to PostgreSQL Migration Technology Webinar, hosted by the IvorySQL community, concluded successfully.
    </div>

    <div className="content-text">
      This webinar focused on the core challenges and solutions throughout the entire process of migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL, specifically highlighting the empowering value of IvorySQL 5.0 in the migration process. Jointly moderated by Grant and Cary, the event invited several technical experts—Hope, Oreo, Cédric, Matthew, and Alvaro—as guest speakers. They engaged in deep discussions around migration technology pain points, core feature adaptation, and supporting tools, providing a detailed interpretation of IvorySQL's core advantages in Oracle syntax compatibility and reducing code rewriting costs. During the meeting, the IvorySQL development roadmap was synchronized, including progress plans for planned features such as Global Index, and the feasibility of contributing compatibility features back to the PostgreSQL community was discussed. Participants were encouraged throughout the event to engage in interactive Q&A to win exclusive gifts, and were guided to deeply participate in project co-construction by visiting the IvorySQL GitHub repository and joining official community channels.

    <h2 className="section-title">Session Content</h2>

    <div className="tech-card">
      <h4>IvorySQL Overview</h4>
      <p className="content-text">Hope and Oreo from the IvorySQL development team jointly introduced the core overview of the project. Launched in December 2021, the project has consistently maintained a synchronization rhythm with new PostgreSQL versions. The session highlighted three core features: the AI subsystem, Oracle semantic compatibility, and cloud-native deployment capabilities. IvorySQL has released its latest stable version (IvorySQL 5.0), and the team plans to launch version 5.1 within a month. At the end of the presentation, the guests showcased new extensions and encoding features and announced the upcoming in-depth seminar featuring Cédric from Data Bene.</p>

    <div className="tech-card">
      <h4>Oracle to PostgreSQL Migration Insights</h4>
      <p className="content-text">Cédric, founder and CEO of Data Bene, shared core challenges of migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL based on European market practices. He emphasized that for large, long-running Oracle databases, ensuring business continuity is the primary difficulty, requiring support from efficient and reliable migration tools. Data Bene's full-process solution enables precise data export and import across different database engines, providing critical support for smooth enterprise migrations. Subsequently, Cary and Grant further discussed the core value of "reducing code rewriting costs," emphasizing it as a key link in improving migration efficiency and controlling project risks.</p>

    <div className="tech-card">
      <h4>Oracle to PostgreSQL Migration Landscape</h4>
      <p className="content-text">Matthew comprehensively deconstructed the full migration process from Oracle to PostgreSQL, focusing on IvorySQL 5.0's solutions for migration pain points. Through a live demonstration, he intuitively showed how IvorySQL's PL/iSQL engine, invisible columns, and case conversion models precisely solve common migration issues. Cary emphasized the community-driven nature of IvorySQL development in this segment, encouraging participants to vote on feature priorities to help align project iterations with actual needs. An interactive Q&A session was set at the end of the presentation, where participants who answered questions correctly received exclusive prizes.</p>

    <div className="tech-card">
      <h4>SQL Feature Roadmap Sharing</h4>
      <p className="content-text">Cary shared the detailed SQL feature roadmap for IvorySQL over the coming year, covering core functions such as Global Index, triggers, nested tables, autonomous transactions, and synonyms. He noted that several planned features align highly with current community voting results for SQL category improvements, reflecting the project's responsiveness to community needs. Cary stressed the importance of community feedback and encouraged users with personalized feature requirements to submit proposals via GitHub. Grant confirmed that the full roadmap and voting results would be synchronized with all participants later.</p>

    <div className="tech-card">
      <h4>IoT and Package Support Discussion</h4>
      <p className="content-text">The team held a specialized discussion on IoT scenario adaptation and Package support. Notably, Package support became the most concerned demand among participants with a 33% support rate. Cary mentioned that Alvaro commented on tool selection, pointing out the performance loss and security risks of Pgpool-II, and suggested adapting and combining solutions from PgBouncer and Patroni. Meanwhile, Alvaro expressed interest in pushing some of IvorySQL's core features into the standard PostgreSQL ecosystem.</p>
    </div>

    <div className="tech-card">
      <h4>PostgreSQL Feature Contribution Discussion</h4>
      <p className="content-text">This webinar specifically explored the feasibility of "contributing features to the PostgreSQL community from cross-compatible projects." Alvaro proposed a core principle: feature contributions must prioritize the overall interests of the PostgreSQL community. Grant added that there are plans to give back highly adaptable features like Global Index to the community, though some Oracle compatibility features might not be suitable for direct migration due to architectural differences between the two databases. Cary further interpreted the complexity and cycle of submitting patches to PostgreSQL, illustrating with an example where a related feature patch took over a year to complete community review and acceptance.</p>
    </div>

    <div className="content-text">
      The webinar concluded with an interactive Q&A session. Representing the organizer, Grant thanked all participants for their support, specifically expressing gratitude to overseas viewers who joined at dawn across time zones. He officially announced that the next PostgreSQL specialized meeting is scheduled for April 27th to 28th, 2026. Once again, participants were guided to participate in project co-construction via the GitHub repository and official community channels.

    <h2 className="section-title">Summary</h2>

    <div>
      <p>This webinar received active responses from global developers, with 32 registered participants and 27 actual attendees. Participants covered multiple countries and regions, including Canada, the United States, France, Spain, India, China, and Germany, achieving efficient exchange of technical experience across borders.</p>
      <p>IvorySQL sincerely thanks all participants for their active involvement and enthusiastic interaction, as well as the guest speakers for their professional insights and shared experience. In the future, the IvorySQL community will continue to focus on technical innovation and ecosystem construction in the field of Oracle to PostgreSQL migration. Through more high-quality technical exchange activities, we aim to build industry communication bridges, help more enterprises break through database migration bottlenecks, achieve smooth transformation, and jointly promote the prosperity and development of the open-source database ecosystem with global community members.</p>
