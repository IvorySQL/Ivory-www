      Exploring open source without boundaries, discussing infinite possibilities together! On November 29th, the 8th China PostgreSQL Database Eco-Conference successfully concluded in Hangzhou. This technical feast, hosted by the PostgreSQL Branch of the China Open Source Software Promotion Alliance and supported by IvorySQL and others, not only brought hardcore cutting-edge dry goods but also created a pure and free dialogue space for DBAs, developers, and technical leaders. Here, there was no distance for technology and communication was unimpeded; it was truly a technical carnival belonging to PGers.

    <h2 className="section-title">Keynote Speech: The Path of Open Source and Community Contribution</h2>
    <div className="content-text">
      At the conference, Dr. Xinjie Lyu, Chairman of the IvorySQL Technical Committee and Vice President of Highgo Database, delivered a keynote speech. He systematically elaborated on Highgo's path of open source and the development achievements of the IvorySQL project, deeply sharing Highgo's core contributions in the PostgreSQL community and its open-source ecosystem empowerment practices.

    <div className="content-text">
      He stated that Highgo has been deeply involved in the open-source field for many years, from initial participation in the technical system to the parallel formation of commercial strategies and open-source combat systems, and finally donating IvorySQL to the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation. It has grown into the most active contribution organization for PG in China, involving more than 30 open-source projects with a cumulative code contribution of over 1.5 million lines.

      <h3>IvorySQL Project History and Technical Highlights</h3>
      <p>Since the launch of version 1.0 in 2021, the IvorySQL project has continued to iterate and upgrade, keeping pace with the evolution of the PostgreSQL kernel. IvorySQL 5.0, released in November 2025, is based on the PG 18 kernel and significantly improves system performance through advanced features such as Asynchronous I/O and Skip Scan. This version adds 21 new compatibility features, supports one-click installation for mainstream architectures such as <code>x86/ARM/MIPS/LoongArch</code>, and is adapted to domestic operating systems like Kylin and UOS. It features comprehensive cloud-native support and online trial functions while strengthening Oracle compatibility to provide users with a convenient and efficient experience. Additionally, IvorySQL actively carries out global joint R&D, reaching cooperation with companies such as OnGres in Spain and Data Bene in France to promote project integration and ecosystem construction.</p>

    <div className="custom-quote">
      <h3>PostgreSQL Community Contribution Results</h3>
      <p>In terms of PostgreSQL community contribution, Highgo has achieved remarkable results. Since July 2025, it has achieved 107 community interactions, 85 code reviews, and 2,029 lines of contributed code, submitting multiple patches and participating in various tests. Core contributions include migrating EUC-CN and GB18030 encoding mappings from XML to UCM format, upgrading the GB18030 encoding to the 2022 version, and optimizing native support for the Chinese environment. Simultaneously, it deeply participated in the review and testing of core functions, promoted documentation and comment optimization, and proposed solutions for synchronization issues of tables without primary keys in logical replication for HIS systems, gaining attention and discussion from important community contributors.</p>

    <div className="custom-quote">
      <h3>Open Source Empowerment System and Practice</h3>
      <p>Highgo has built a comprehensive empowerment system covering talent, ecosystem, products, business, technology, foundations, communities, and funds. It cultivates professional talents through university cooperation and community training; promotes hardware and software adaptation and industry standard-setting by uniting the industrial chain; builds a complete product matrix to lower the threshold for use; and constructs a diversified business model driven by both community and commerce. In practical application, it successfully provided a localized database transformation solution for the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), achieving "second-level" upgrades across versions, zero application modification, and seamless compatibility with surrounding tools, ensuring business continuity. Furthermore, Highgo participated in the establishment of the Taishan Open Source Technology Incubator to promote open-source project incubation and industrial implementation.</p>
