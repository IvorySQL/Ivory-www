Hi guys, PostgresWorld Webinars is back!

PostgreSQL plays an important role in the development of databases in China. Many database products around the world choose PostgreSQL as their technology development path. **However, the problem of migrating applications from Oracle to Open source Postgres became the biggest obstacle,** so we created the IvorySQL open source project, which is based on the latest PostgreSQL 14 database with strong Oracle compatibility.
But why do we have to do IvorySQL open source project? How is it technically different from Postgres and Oracle? This webinar invites you to join us.

This webinar is hosted by Grant Zhou on IvorySQL - An Open Source Oracle-compatible Database Based on PostgreSQL.

## Guest introduction

**Grant Zhou** currently lived in Canada, he is the founder of Highgo Software North America, and he is leading the company PostgreSQL development team with members from Canada, China and Pakistan. He is working as the secretary of the International Consultant Committee of the PostgreSQL China Association at the same time, and also proud to be the Organizer & Asia Liaison at PostgresConf. He worked in Alcatel-Lucent (Nokia) company for more than ten years and had rich experiences on high availability, real-time telecommunication systems, database technologies and Unix/Linux programming.

In December 2021, the team announced the first available version of IvorySQL database, **which is the only open source database with Oracle compatibility features based on PostgreSQL**. On Feburay 28, 2022, based on PostgreSQL 14.2, IvorySQL 1.2 was released.

## Conference Highlights

There are many users who need to migrate their applications from Oracle to the open source Postgres, but in order to support the new database, users often need to re-develop the application, which is inconvenient. If there is a database based on Postgres and compatible with most Oracle syntax and functions, it will be too convenient for customers. However, the official Postgres project will not accept this kind of code submission. After all, Postgres is Postgres, and Oracle is Oracle.
So, let's make an Oracle compatible database.
This talk will introduce how to make a database compatible with Oracle syntax based on PG, and introduce the IvorySQL project. This project is an open source project (Apache 2.0) led by Highgo Software and currently has released version 1.2 based on PostgreSQL 14.2.
**Welcome everyone to contribute to this open source Oracle compatible database - IvorySQL, powered by PostgreSQL.**
